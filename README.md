## Bakeland - Unifying chains by putting them at wars
Bakeland is game where you can play against your friends across multiple chains. Bakeland is catering two major type of crypto native audiance
  - **Chain Hoppers** - people who hop around the chains for better incentives
  - **Chain loyalist** - People who are are loyal to one chain

Bakeland put these users from different chains in single battleground which has **a unified global state**. Players can do multiple activites and can have multiple roles. Two major roles which determine game mechanics are
  **FARMER** - Staked $BUDS and get boosted staking rewards
  **NARC** - Raids staking pools on any chain
  
User can acquire these roles by getting a FARMER or NARC NFT. Users can do following operations despite :-
  - **Staking** - User can stake in-game native token $BUDS to get staking rewards. One can stake on same chain or other chain as well depending on APR           offered by a chain.
  - **Raiding** - User can raid the staking pools of any chain. Only NARC NFT holders can perform raids. It is probablistic and dependent on a probablistic       success rate derived from various factors. (We have used Supra dVRF for on chain randomness)
  - **Gambling for booster NFTs and extra rewards** - User can burn some amount of $BUDS in return for 50% chance of winning a Booster NFT which will help       to increase staking reward or raid success chances. (We have used Supra dVRF for on chain randomness)
  - **Play PvP minigames** against other players.
  - **bridge tokens and NFTs** from one chain to another chain** in game itself.**
  
## Problem statement 
  92% of crypto native people have **a preffered network. **
  This prefference has **led to tribalism. **
  The sense of **tribalism has led users to keep themselve bound to a single chain.** 
  This **resulted in** **fragmented ecosystems, fragmented liquidity, and fragmented user base.**

## Solution
  1. **Unified Liquidiy** across the chains using **wormhole CCQ**
  2. **Unified state of assets** across the chains using **wormhole CCQ**
  3. Composibility of game assets
  4. Liquidity balancing game theory
  5. Gamified omni-chain economy
